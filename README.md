# Hackathon-Health-2019-Antisseptico
Equipe Antiss√©ptico - Health Hackathon.

We developed an artificial intelligence solution to help healthcare professionals to open the sepsis protocol based of the Global Sepsis Alliance. Our objective is to drastically reduce the application time of the first dose of the antibiotic analyzing the bodily temperature, breath rate, cardiac rate, and some others. We applied the machine learning algorithm decision tree to identify which of the patients should be prioritized. 
For the frontend part, we developed responsive application using the React technology to demonstrate the functionalities through the user interfaces.
